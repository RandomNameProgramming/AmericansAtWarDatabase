                <h2>During this time period African Ameicans could rarely fight in the Military because it was decided that giving slaves, or free blacks, weapons and military equipment was not the best idea.</h2>
                <h2>Shortly after the beginning of the French and Indian multiple colonies needed extra troops and began inlisting blacks to fill the gaps.</h2>
                <h2>Free blacks were allowed to fight for the British Army furing the war. They only ever held low positions in the army though.</h2>
                <h2>Those left behind frequently took up the slack of the people who left for war.</h2>
